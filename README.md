# Weatherbackend.

We have used MYSQL database for storing the data and have connected the input data using python.
We have created an integrated file operations.py which has menu driven program through which the user can access each function by entering the choice number from 1 to 4.

 These are the  5 sub files .
1. create.py to create new entries by the user.
2. read.py to read the data entered by the user.
3. delete.py to delete the entries by the user.
4. update.py to update existing weather entry.
5. gmapapi.py to show the latitude and longitudes of the location entered by the user as well a link to the image of  location of the place.
6. export.py to export the database data into a csv file.
   There is a report file attached in the repo which contains the outputs of the operations.
